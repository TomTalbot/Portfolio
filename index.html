        <!--SECTION 4 about me-->
        <section id ="about-me" class="about-me-section">
            <h2>About me and my studies</h2>
            <p>I am a second year software engineering student studying at Nottingham Trent university. As previously mentioned, my strengths lie with python and web development. I enjoy applying my problem-solving skills to design and implement efficient solutions. I have a strong interest in backend development and am especially drawn to Python as a language for its versatility and wide application. I am eager to apply the skills I've developed throughout my studies in real world problems providing solutions that will make a difference.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time at university I've had a wide range of opportunies to grow as an engineer and demonstrate my skills in a practical manner. These opportunities vary from learning new technologies such as; C++, Java and SQL - learning these languages has greatly improved the depth of my skills and allowed me to further build upon the concepts I already had a grasp upon.</p>
            <p>I am currently operating at an Upper Second-Class (2:1) average for my first year overall (with second-year grades pending). I have particularly excelled in modules involving practical, hands-on work. For example, in Foundations of Computing and Technology, which involved extensive use of Python, I achieved a First-class grade. I also attained a First-class result in a C++ class test, demonstrating my adaptability to different programming paradigms. I thrive in environments that provide creative freedom, as these allow me to apply my technical knowledge while exploring innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>I find that working within a team is the most effective way for me to develop as a software engineer. Collaborating with others allows me to learn practically, gaining insight into different approaches, best practices, and problem-solving strategies. I thrive in environments where knowledge is shared, as this hands-on learning helps me strengthen my skills, adapt to new technologies, and contribute meaningfully to projects. Being part of a team also teaches me the importance of communication, code quality, and agile workflows, all of which are crucial in a professional software engineering setting.</p>
